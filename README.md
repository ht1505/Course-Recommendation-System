CourseFindr: Content-Based Course Recommendation System
CourseFindr is a static web application designed to help users find relevant online learning courses. It demonstrates a client-side Content-Based Filtering algorithm to deliver personalized course recommendations based on user interaction (favoriting).

The project was refactored from a monolithic file structure into a modular, maintainable JavaScript architecture, and its data was scaled up using a real-world dataset.

üöÄ Key Features and Enhancements
Content-Based Recommendation Engine: The core feature dynamically analyzes a logged-in user's favorited courses (tags, difficulty, subject) and generates personalized recommendations based on those traits.

Massive Dataset Handling: Utilizes an expanded dataset of 3,678 courses derived from real Udemy data, replacing the previous manual input.

Modular Architecture: Refactored from a single file into decoupled JavaScript logic (script.js now combines Authentication, Filtering, and Display functions) to improve maintainability and performance.

Robust Filtering & Search: Advanced client-side filtering functions for Price, Duration (with corrected logic for precise ranges), and Difficulty, plus a unified keyword search across course titles, instructors, and tags.

Simulated Asynchronous Data Flow: Courses are loaded from the local data/courses.json file using the native fetch() API, simulating an asynchronous call to a backend REST service.

Secure Mock Authentication: Implements client-side user management using localStorage for sessions and favorites, explicitly avoiding the storage of passwords for security compliance.

üìÅ Project Structure
The project maintains a simple, static structure optimized for deployment:

Course-Recommendation-System/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ courses.json     # The large, structured course dataset (3,678 records)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html           # Main application entry point (HTML5 structure)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css           # Custom CSS for styling and responsiveness
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js            # Combined JavaScript logic (Auth, Filters, Display)


üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Local Setup
Since this project uses advanced JavaScript features (type="module" in the original architecture, and relies on correct paths), it must be run via a local web server:

Clone the Repository: Download the project files.

Organize Files: Ensure the single script.js file is in the root directory and the courses.json file is inside the data/ subfolder.

Start a Local Server:

VS Code: Use the "Live Server" extension (right-click index.html > "Open with Live Server").

Python: Navigate to the root directory in your terminal and run: python -m http.server 8000

Access: Open your browser to the local host address (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5500).

üíª How to Use the Recommendation Feature
Sign Up / Log In: Click "Sign Up" in the header and create a mock account (credentials are stored only in your browser's local storage).

Favorite Courses: Browse the main list and click the heart icon on 3-5 courses across different topics (e.g., one Python course, one Finance course).

View Recommendations: The "Recommended for You" section at the top will instantly populate with courses sharing tags, subjects, or difficulty levels of your favorited items.

‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment
This project is configured as a purely static application and can be deployed instantly using Vercel or any similar static hosting service. No build process is required, making deployment straightforward.
